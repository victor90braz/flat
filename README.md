In this project, you can store your images in the `public/images` directory. To access these images in your application, you can use the following URLs:

-   ![Flat Tests Image](/public/storage/images/flat-tests.png) # Image of Flat Tests
-   ![Home Image](/public/storage/images/home.png) # Image of Home
